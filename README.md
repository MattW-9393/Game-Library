## :video_game: View my library of video-games I've recently played :video_game:

I'm creating a library of video games I have recently played in order to improve my JavaScript.

The aim is to submit an HTML form that adds a new 'video-game' and some basic information about it, to a pseudo/database in JS.

Using the DOM-Manipulation, JS functions will be triggered to display a list of entries.
Form the list users will be able to drill down and view more information about the video games.
